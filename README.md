# Purpose

This project was inspired from freeCodeCamp's Learn Javascript By Creating an RPG tutorial. I expanded on many aspects from the original, and added new features. 

The main goal was to use this project to: 

1. Practice key JavaScript fundamentals
2. Get familiar with using git/github

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
